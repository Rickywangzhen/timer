The programming used ’clock_getting’ function to get time before and after the call in nanosecond. The method is the second time minus the first time to get the cost of the call. N is the loop times for function/system/read calls and N increases cause decreasing in the cost of minimal call, because the accuracy is getting better and better. The cost of the function call is always less than the cost of the system call. The result is same as I googled.
